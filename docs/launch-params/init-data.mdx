# Init data

## Description

In the list of [launch parameters](./about.md), initialization data is located in
the `tgWebAppData` parameter. They are a set of data mostly
related to a specific user who launched the TWA application.

A striking feature of init data is the fact that they can
be used as an authentication or authorization factor. For this reason
, do not forget about the security of the application.

:::caution

This parameter will be missing in case, TWA application was opened via
KeyboardButton (keyboard in the dialogue with user).

:::

## Extraction

To extract init data, it is required to firstly get the launch parameters,
then extract parameter with name `tgWebAppData` and pass it to the
`URLSearchParams` constructor:

```typescript title="Example of a processed value"
// Get launch parameters.
const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.slice(1));

// Convert it to more user-friendly object.
const initDataString = params.get('tgWebAppData'); // user=...&query_id=...&...
const initData = new URLSearchParams(initDataString);
console.log(initData.get('query_id')); // jsHS198czozxk7s 
```

## Authorization and authentication

A special feature of initialization data is the ability to be used as a factor
for authorization or authentication. The fact is that the data generated by the
native Telegram application is signed with the secret key of the Telegram bot,
after which the generated signature is placed next to the parameters themselves.

Thus, knowing the secret key of the Telegram bot, the developer has the
opportunity to verify the signature of the parameters and make sure that
they were indeed issued to the specified user.

Also, the signature verification operation is fast enough and does not require
large server resources. More information about the data signature and
verification algorithm can be found in
[this](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#validating-data-received-via-the-web-app)
documentation.

## Sending to server

In order to authorize the user on the server, the developer needs to transmit
the initialization data that was specified when launching the TWA application.
To make life easier for yourself, the developer can transmit them at each
request to the server, after which the signature verification is carried out
on the server side.

Here comes the example with the usage of such library as `axios`:

```typescript title="Example of passing init data"
import axios from 'axios';

const initData = new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.slice(1))
  .get('tgWebAppData');

if (initData === null) {
  throw new Error('Ooof! Something is wrong. Init data is missing');
}

// Create axios instance.  
const http = axios.create({
  headers: {
    // Append authorization header. 
    Authorization: `twa-init-data ${initData}`,
  }
});
```

In turn, the following actions must be performed on the server side:

1. Get the value of the `Authorization` header;
2. Check that the first part of it is equal to `twa-init-data`;
3. Get initialization data and verify its signature.

If this algorithm is successful, the server part of the application can trust
the transmitted initialization data.

:::tip

In real-world applications, it is recommended to use additional mechanisms
for verifying initialization data. For example, add their expiration date. This
check can be implemented using the `auth_date` parameter, which is responsible
for the date when the parameters were created. This solution will allow in case
of theft of initialization data to prevent their constant use by an attacker.

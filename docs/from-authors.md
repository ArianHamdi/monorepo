# From authors

Hey developer! We spent a lot of time researching the Telegram platform to
create something useful, something, that will help you to learn it much faster
than we did.

Telegram documentation is rather specific and takes a lot of time to find
something you really need. But what if you don't even know about the
functionality you could use? How could you find it in some huge like universe
documentation like Telegram's one? This is another problem we are trying to
solve.

It would be best if you remembered, that enthusiasts, not Telegram developers,
created this documentation. We could miss something, or make mistakes, but we
are doing our best to improve your experience.

We wrote this documentation following this order:

1. Provide basic, surface information about the platform;
2. Dive deeper into the technical part to learn how the platform works on a low
   level;
3. Smoothly decrease the level of technical learning in favor of more
   feature-like style learning, referring to previously provided technical
   information.

This will make your studying more consistent and understandable.

:::caution

This documentation is currently under heavy development and could be changed
at any time.

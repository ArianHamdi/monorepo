# Back Button

The main task that the Back Button performs is to provide a seemingly native
way to go back in the routing history. However, Telegram does not restrict
the developer in the ways of using the Back Button and allows him to handle
the component click event as required in the application.

import imgURL from '../../static/img/ui/back-button.png';

<img
  src={imgURL}
  alt={'Back Button'}
  style={{marginBottom: 20, maxWidth: '100%'}}
  width={300}
/>

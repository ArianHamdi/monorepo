# Main Button

The Main Button is a component that is usually used when it is necessary to
perform some final action.

An example of the use case of this component is sending data. For example, a
TWA application may involve selecting products from a catalog and
filling a user's shopping cart. At the moment when products appear in the cart,
the developer can display the Main Button, clicking on which will cause the
creation and processing of the order.

import imgURL from '../../static/img/ui/main-button.png';

<img
  src={imgURL}
  alt={'Main Button'}
  style={{marginBottom: 20, maxWidth: '100%'}}
  width={300}
/>

This is a fairly large and at the same time simple component that provides
narrow functionality. The developer has the ability to control the following
properties of the Main Button:

- Text
- Text color
- Background color
- Visibility
- Loader visibility
- Activity state

:::tip

If clicking on the button produces an action that takes some time to complete,
it is recommended to display the loader inside the Main Button. This will allow
the user to understand that the application is not frozen and is currently
performing an operation.

# Required technologies

Before starting to create an application on the Web Apps platform, it is
important to know what Web Apps is from its technical side. This will lead the
developer to language and technologies selection.

Internally, Web Apps are usual web applications, which are displayed in WebView.
In other words, they are just a set of static files (mostly `.js`, `.css`,
and `.html`). So, to create Web App, it is enough to learn standard front-end
development technologies, such as:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

Really simple, isn't it? But to make much more serious and bigger applications,
we recommend using more solid technologies, such
as `TypeScript`, `React`, `SCSS`, etc.

So, if we want to create Web App, we should create a standard web application
with any technologies stack. The only 1 thing Telegram needs from the developer
is the application URL to download it from. It will be used as a source for
WebView, which will lead to application download and display.

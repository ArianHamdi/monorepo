# About platform

Telegram Web Apps is a technology created by developers of the famous messenger
Telegram.
The main itâ€™s purpose is to provide developers more flexible communication
channel with Telegram users.

It may seem not clear, but Web Apps are not self-served services. The first
thing to note is, technically, this technology is just an add-on for such
already-known Telegram functionality as Telegram Bots. So, currently, creating a
Web App without creating a Telegram Bot is not available.

The platform offers a high variety of available methods to communicate with the
Telegram application to make your web applications look more native, allow them
to simulate native application's behavior, and, finally, **mimic** native
applications.

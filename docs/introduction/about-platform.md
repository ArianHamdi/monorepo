# About platform

Telegram Web Apps is a technology created by developers of the famous messenger
Telegram.
The main itâ€™s purpose is to provide developers more flexible communication
channel with Telegram users.

It may seem not clear, but Web Apps are not self-served services. The first
thing to note is, technically, this technology is just an add-on for such
already-known Telegram functionality as Telegram Bots. So, currently, creating a
Web App without creating a Telegram Bot is not available.

The platform offers a high variety of available methods to communicate with the
Telegram application to make your web applications look more native, allow them
to simulate native application's behavior, and, finally, **mimic** native
applications.

This documentation provides information about the whole Web Apps platform - its
concepts, workflow, features, libraries, etc. It also contains tutorials and
notes for developers, which will be rather useful in the process of application
development.

In the introduction section, we will learn essential information about the
platform. Then, we will deep dive into the technical part of it smoothly ending
with more feature-like style sections.

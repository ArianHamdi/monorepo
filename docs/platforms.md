# Platforms

Currently, Web Apps are presented on a really small list of platforms (a unique
platform name is specified next to its title):

- [Telegram Android](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) `android`;
- [Telegram iOS](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS) `ios`;
- [Telegram macOS](https://github.com/overtake/TelegramSwift) `macos`;
- [Telegram Desktop](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop) `tdesktop`;
- [Telegram Web Z](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt) `webz`.

Other platforms either don't have implementation for Telegram Web Apps, or
support it too poorly. This will probably be useful in the next sections of the
documentation.

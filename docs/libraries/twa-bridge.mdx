# @twa.js/bridge

<LibraryBadges pkg={'@twa.js/bridge'}/>

The package which provides utilities to simplify communication between Web App
and Telegram native application. It also solves some across-platform data
difference problems to protect developers' code and save their time.

Developers could also use this package to make their SDK as long as it provides
the lowest level of control over the cross applications' communication.

## Installation

<NpmInstall pkg={'@twa.js/bridge'}/>

## Init

The `Bridge` component has a relatively simple API. Its primary purpose is to
provide communication layer between Telegram native and client applications,
so you could call native methods and receive events from the Telegram
application.

To start using `Bridge`, it is enough to use its static `init` function:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();
```

This function will append special handler to global window object, which is
used by Telegram native application and make this instance work correctly.

### Debugging

`Bridge` supports debug mode which outputs additional log messages into the
console. By default, this mode is disabled. To enable it, it is required to
pass the `debug: true` option while creating a new `Bridge` instance.

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init({debug: true});
```

Or, in case when an instance already exists, just change its `debug` property
to `true`:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init({debug: true});
bridge.debug = true;
```

### Target origin

In case, the current bridge instance is used in a browser environment (iframe),
we use such function as `window.parent.postMessage` which requires passing
target origin to prevent sending events to untrusted parent iframes. By
default, bridge uses such origin as `https://web.telegram.org`. To allow
sending events to other origins, you should use `targetOrigin` option:

```typescript
const unsafeBridge = Bridge.init({targetOrigin: '*'});
// or
const safeBridge = Bridge.init({targetOrigin: 'https://myendpoint.org'});
```

It is strongly recommended not to override this value as long as it could lead
to security issues. Specify this value only for test purposes.

## Calling methods

### With `Bridge`

To call Web Apps methods, it is enough to call `Bridge`s `postEvent` method.
This method automatically finds a correct way of sending events which depends
on the current environment. Let's take a look at a simple example:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();

// Close current application.
bridge.postEvent('web_app_close');
```

Some methods don't require parameters and can be called without an additional
second parameter representing the event payload. But some events do require it:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();

// Open new popup.
bridge.postEvent('web_app_open_popup', {
  title: 'Web Apps Notification',
  message: 'I love Web Apps',
  buttons: [{type: 'ok', id: 'ok'}]
});
```

### Without `Bridge`

This package allows calling methods without creating a new `Bridge` instance.
To perform this action, you should use the `postEvent` function which has the
same type as `bridge.postEvent` (actually, the bridge uses the `postEvent`
function internally):

```typescript
import {postEvent} from '@twa.js/bridge';

postEvent('web_app_setup_back_button', {is_visible: true});
```

Nevertheless, sometimes you need to handle events sent from the native app
emitted as a response to the called method. For example, you would like to
call the `web_app_request_theme` method. As a result, the native app will
emit a `theme_changed` event. Using the default bridge init flow, this event
will be captured by the bridge instance. We can't say the same about the bare
`postEvent` function, so, do not forget about the response event (if it exists)
handling process.

## Listening to events

Events tracking is rather simple thing too. For this purpose, we could
use such methods as `on` and `subscribe`. To remove event listeners, we
use `off` and `unsubscribe`:

```typescript
import {BridgeEventListener, BridgeEventName, Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();
const listener: BridgeEventListener<'viewport_changed'> = payload => {
  console.log('Viewport changed:', payload)
};
const subListener = (event: BridgeEventName, ...args: any[]) => {
  console.log('Event was called:', event, ...args);
};

// Add event listener.
bridge.on('viewport_changed', listener);

// Add listener for all events.
bridge.subscribe(subListener);

// Remove event listeners.
bridge.off('viewport_changed', listener);
bridge.unsubscribe(subListener);
```

## Checking method support

Bridge itself does not check if the Web Apps method is supported by the current
version of the platform. To check, if the method is supported, you could use
the `supports` function:

```typescript
import {supports} from '@twa.js/bridge';

supports('web_app_trigger_haptic_feedback', '6.0'); // false
supports('web_app_trigger_haptic_feedback', '6.1'); // true
```

It is recommended to use this function before calling Web Apps methods to
prevent applications from stalling and other unexpected behavior.

## Higher-level control

As long as the bridge provides only low-level control, we recommend using
[SDK](twa-sdk/about) which implements bridge methods. It also provides
additional parameter checks, more intuitive method names, and easier usage.

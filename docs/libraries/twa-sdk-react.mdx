# @twa.js/sdk-react

React bindings for [client SDK](twa-sdk/about). Contains hooks, components and other
useful tools which allow usage of React along with Web Apps client SDK.
Tracks SDK components changes out of box.

<LibraryBadges pkg={'@twa.js/sdk-react'}/>

## Installation

Before everything, it is assumed, that you already installed `react` package
as long as this package has it as the peer dependency. Installation of SDK
itself is not required, `@twa.js/sdk-react` already includes it.

<NpmInstall pkg={'@twa.js/sdk-react'}/>

## Initialization

### Using SDK provider

According to the `@twa.js/sdk` [documentation](twa-sdk/about), it represents
a set of components, which are not initialized by default and a developer
should create them by himself. Additionally, the SDK provides the function
called `init` which allows developers not to think about *how do I even
should create these components and use standard TWA flow?* It just does
everything required for a developer.

So, the first thing we have to do here is to provide application
the SDK functionality and allow it calling the initialization to get newly
created components. For this purpose, the component `SDKProvider` exists:

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import {SDKProvider} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

function Root() {
  return (
    <SDKProvider>
      <div>My application!</div>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

Internally, `SDKProvider` uses `init` function from `@twa.js/sdk`. It accepts
list of optional parameters via `initOptions` property described
[here](twa-sdk/about#init):

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import {SDKProvider, InitOptions} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

/**
 * Root component for the whole project.
 */
export function Root() {
  const options: InitOptions = {
    acceptScrollbarStyle: true,
    checkCompat: true,
    debug: true
  };

  return (
    <SDKProvider initOptions={options}>
      <div>My application!</div>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

Most of the time, there is no need to use `initOptions` unless you have some
specific logic in your application. Usually, the SDK does everything a
developer needs by itself.

### Getting SDK context

Usage of `SDKProvider` component allows its child elements to use hook
`useSDK` (or `withSDK` HOC) returning core SDK information:

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import {SDKProvider, SDKContext, useSDK, withSDK} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

function App() {
  const sdk = useSDK();

  // Here, we can use SDK information.

  return <div>My application!</div>;
}

// or

interface Props {
  sdk: SDKContext
}

function AppPure({sdk}: Props) {
  return <div>My application!</div>;
}

const AppWrapped = withSDK(AppPure);

function Root() {
  return (
    <SDKProvider>
      <App/>
      {/* or */}
      <AppWrapped/>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

Let's complicate previous example and add important logic connected with the
SDK lifecycle:

```typescript jsx
import React, {PropsWithChildren, useEffect} from 'react';
import {SDKProvider, useSDK, useBackButton, useWebApp} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

/**
 * Part of application which doesn't know anything about SDK initialization
 * and which should be rendered only in case, SDK is already initialized and
 * could provide Web Apps components.
 */
function App() {
  const backButton = useBackButton();
  const webApp = useWebApp();

  // When App is attached to DOM, lets show back button and
  // add "click" event handler, which should close current application.
  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = () => webApp.close();
    backButton.on('click', listener);
    backButton.show();

    return () => {
      backButton.off('click', listener);
      backButton.hide();
    };
    // We know, that backButton and webApp will never change,
    // but let's follow React rules.
  }, [backButton, webApp]);

  return <div>My application!</div>;
}

/**
 * This component is the layer controlling the application display. It displays
 * application in case, the SDK is initialized, displays an error if something
 * went wrong, and a loader if the SDK is warming up.
 */
function Loader({children}: PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  const {didInit, components, error} = useSDK();

  // There were no calls of SDK's init function. It means, we did not
  // even try to do it.
  if (!didInit) {
    return <div>SDK init function is not yet called.</div>;
  }

  // Error occurred during SDK init.
  if (error !== null) {
    return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;
  }

  // If components is null, it means, SDK is not ready at the
  // moment and currently initializing. Usually, it takes like
  // several milliseconds or something like that, but we should
  // have this check.
  if (components === null) {
    return <div>Warming up SDK.</div>;
  }

  // Safely render application.
  return <>{children}</>;
}

/**
 * Root component of the whole project.
 */
export function Root() {
  return (
    <SDKProvider>
      <Loader>
        <App/>
      </Loader>
    </SDKProvider>
  );
}
```

You could probably ask why we should use component like `Loader`. The problem
is, as long as the SDK initialization is asynchronous (some of its components
should send requests to the Telegram application to retrieve their current
state), we could not determine which properties its components should have.
That is the reason, why `SDKProvider` can not provide valid `components`
until initialization is completed.

As the result, all hooks which return component instances will throw an error
as long as they could not get their component from `components` property. That's
why these hooks should not be called until SDK is initialized.

### When init is done

When initialization was completed successfully, developer should call
`webApp.ready` function. This will notify the Telegram application about
current Web App is ready to be displayed.

```typescript jsx
import {useWebApp} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';
import React, {useEffect} from 'react';

function App() {
  const webApp = useWebApp();

  useEffect(() => {
    webApp.ready();
  }, [webApp]);

  return <div>Here is my App</div>;
}
```

## Hooks and HOCs

### Launch parameters

There could be a case, when a developer needs to get launch parameters without
initializing whole SDK. For example, he would like to get current theme
parameters which are usually stored in the `window.location`. We, probably, don't
need the SDK initialization for it, right?

To get Web App launch parameters, hook `useLaunchParams` (or `withLaunchParams` HOC)
should be used:

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import {useLaunchParams, withLaunchParams, LaunchParams} from '@twa.js/sdk-react';

function DisplayLaunchParams() {
  const launchParams = useLaunchParams();

  return (
    <pre>
      <code>{JSON.stringify(launchParams, null, ' ')}</code>
    </pre>
  );
}

// or

interface Props {
  launchParams: LaunchParams;
}

function DisplayLaunchParamsPure({launchParams}: Props) {
  return (
    <pre>
      <code>{JSON.stringify(launchParams, null, ' ')}</code>
    </pre>
  );
}

const DisplayLaunchParamsWrapped = withLaunchParams(DisplayLaunchParams);
```

It will return the result of the [`retrieveLaunchParams`](twa-sdk/about#launch-parameters)
function.

### Other

Library provides list of dead simple hooks and HOCs for each SDK component.
Returned instances are always the same, but force updates will be called
in case, something changed in a component.

:::caution

In case, you use HOCs, pay attention to the fact, that passed components are
always the same instances. This may lead to problems with `PureComponent` and
`memo` React components as long as they will not catch any changes in references.
Do not create new components instances as long as it will lead to new problems
connected with events listening done during SDK initialization process.

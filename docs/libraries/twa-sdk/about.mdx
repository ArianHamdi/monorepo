# @twa.js/sdk

Made from scratch the TypeScript library for communication with the Telegram
Web Apps functionality.

Code of this library was written with the aim to make developers communication
with the Telegram Web Apps way easier. It contains a lot of separate
components which are responsible for their own part of the Telegram Web Apps
ecosystem.

Before starting to use the SDK, we highly recommend learning the Web Apps
[documentation](../../introduction/web-apps) to understand the platform
concepts.

<LibraryBadges pkg={'@twa.js/sdk'}/>

## Installation

<NpmInstall pkg={'@twa.js/sdk'}/>

## Initialization

According to the logic, this package provides the full control over its
lifecycle, its initialization is on the developer shoulders. It means, that
there are no already initialized global components which could be used by
developer, they should be created by himself.

To make the developer life easier, package contains special function called
`init` which returns initialized components instances:

```typescript
import {init} from '@twa.js/sdk';

init().then(components => {
  // Now we have all initialized components.
  const {mainButton, viewport} = components;

  // Add main button event click which will lead to
  // application expansion.
  mainButton.on('click', () => viewport.expand());

  // Update main button information and show it.
  mainButton
    .setColor('#ff0000')
    .setTextColor('#ffffff')
    .setText('Expand')
    .enable()
    .show();
});
```

### Options

The `init` function is capable of accepting options, which are specified in the
object in the first argument of function. Each option and the options object
itself are optional.

```typescript
import {init} from '@twa.js/sdk';

init(options);
```

#### `debug: boolean`

Enables the debug mode which leads to printing more debugging information sent
by the SDK. This option is also passed to the `Bridge` instance during its
initialization.

#### `checkCompat: boolean`

Enables the mode in which calls of the methods not supported by the current
version of the Web App will lead to throwing an error. This mode is
recommended to be used and enabled by default.

#### `targetOrigin: string`

This option is directly passed to the `Bridge` during its initialization. It
restricts the list of parent iframes allowed to receive data from the current
application. To learn more about this option, follow this
[documentation](../twa-bridge#target-origin).

## Launch parameters

The launch parameters are initial parameters passed to the Web App. You can
learn more about launch parameters in this
[documentation](../../launch-params/structure).

A developer is allowed to retrieve the launch parameters by the usage of
the `retrieveLaunchParams` function. Simply put, this function parses
the parameters starting with the `tgWebApp` prefix.

```typescript
import {retrieveLaunchParams} from '@twa.js/sdk';

console.log(retrieveLaunchParams());

// Output:
// {
//   version: '6.4',
//   initData: {
//     authDate: Mon Feb 20 2023 04:11:25 GMT+0000,
//     hash: 'kSJkn101-)S(djn1',
//   },
//   platform: 'android',
//   themeParams: {
//     backgroundColor: '#ffaabb',
//     buttonColor: '#223112',
//     buttonTextColor: '#111aa3',
//     hintColor: '#000000',
//     linkColor: '#ffffff',
//     secondaryBackgroundColor: '#aaaaaa',
//     textColor: '#bbbbbb',
//   },
// };
```

This function needs no SDK initialization or something like that. It attempts
to extract the launch parameters from the `window.location`. In case, they are
invalid or missing, the function will try to extract these parameters from the
`sessionStorage`. This function is safe to be used when a user reloads Web App
via the `Reload Page` application button.

## Components

All components in this package are supposed to be used as singletons. It means,
you should not create several instances of the same component and use them even
if it is not forbidden. Nevertheless, in this case, there is no warranty,
everything will work fine.

The reason is, each component class stores its state locally and class instances
are not synchronized between each other. So, for instance, in case, developer
creates 2 instances of the `Popup` component and one of them calls `open()`
method, it will change its `isOpened` property to `true`, but the second
instance of `Popup` will not know about it and will still return
`false` value, which is incorrect.

To avoid possible problems, developer can rely on package's `init` function
which provides initialized components which are enough to use across the
application.

### Events

Component instances use the common way of events listening through the `on` and
`off` functions. Here is the example with the `BackButton` component:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from '@twa.js/sdk';

const backButton = new BackButton(...);
backButton.on('click', () => {
  console.log('Back button clicked.');
});
```

You can find the list of supported events in components own documentations.

### Methods support

Almost each component is capable of checking whether its method is supported by
the current Web Apps version or not. To check if some methods are supported,
developer should use the component instance `supports()` function. For example:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from '@twa.js/sdk';
import {Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

let backButton = new BackButton(Bridge.init(), '6.0');
console.log(backButton.supports('show')); // false

backButton = new BackButton(Bridge.init(), '6.3');
console.log(backButton.supports('hide')); // true
```

It is recommended to use this functionality before calling some component method
as long as this will make developer sure, it will work. The list of supported
methods by components is described in each component documentation.

# Usage

As we mentioned in the previous section, Web Apps are add-ons for Telegram Bots.
Telegram Bots is also known technology that provides functionality for a wide
list of use cases. You could create a bot to buy a ticket in the cinema, make
him tell user jokes, generate random numbers, etc. In other words, the bot can
do whatever the developer thinks about.

The problem is, the visual part of bots is not as good and functional as it
could be. Their current implementation is "console-like" which is more
appropriate for developers, not common users. That's the time for Web Apps to
show up.

Using Web Apps, developers are allowed to create more user-friendly and complex
interfaces, which are commonly used by usual users. With this technology, the
developer is still able to communicate with the bot behind Web App, but,
additionally, he can provide some more flexible interfaces to interact with.

Web Apps are usually used when a standard bot interface is not enough. Create a
Web App when you want to make user life easier when displaying several buttons
is not even close to the functionality, you want to provide.

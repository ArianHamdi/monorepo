# @twa-dev/bridge

<LibraryBadges pkg={'@twa-dev/bridge'}/>

The package provides utilities to simplify communication between web
applications and the Telegram native application. It also addresses
cross-platform data differences, safeguarding developers' code and saving their time.

Developers can utilize this package to create their software development
kit (SDK), as it offers the utmost level of control over
cross-application communication.

## Installation

<NpmInstall pkg={'@twa-dev/bridge'}/>

## Init

The `Bridge` component has a relatively simple API. Its primary purpose is
to provide a communication layer between the Telegram native and client
applications, allowing you to invoke native methods and receive events from
the Telegram application.

To start using Bridge, simply utilize its static `init` function:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();
```

This function will append special handler to global window object, which is
used by Telegram native application and make this instance work correctly.

:::info

You can use `Bridge.init()` as many times as required. This will not make
any effect on already created `Bridge` instances.

### Debugging

`Bridge` supports debug mode which outputs additional log messages into the
console. By default, this mode is disabled. To enable it, it is required to
pass the `debug: true` option while creating a new `Bridge` instance.

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init({debug: true});
```

Or in case when an instance already exists, just change its `debug` property
to `true`:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init({debug: true});
bridge.debug = true;
```

### Target origin

If the current bridge instance is being used in a browser environment (iframe),
we employ the function `window.parent.postMessage`. This function requires
specifying the target origin to ensure events are only sent to trusted
parent iframes. By default, the bridge utilizes `https://web.telegram.org`
as the origin. To enable event transmission to other origins, you should
utilize the `targetOrigin` option:

```typescript
const unsafeBridge = Bridge.init({targetOrigin: '*'});
// or
const safeBridge = Bridge.init({targetOrigin: 'https://myendpoint.org'});
```

It is strongly recommended not to override this value as long as it could lead
to security issues. Specify this value only for test purposes.

## Calling methods

### With `Bridge`

To call Web Apps methods, it is enough to call `Bridge`s `postEvent` method.
This method automatically finds a correct way of sending events which depends
on the current environment. Let's take a look at a simple example:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();

// Close current application.
bridge.postEvent('web_app_close');
```

Some methods don't require parameters and can be called without an additional
second parameter representing the event payload. But some events do require it:

```typescript
import {Bridge} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();

// Open new popup.
bridge.postEvent('web_app_open_popup', {
  title: 'Web Apps Notification',
  message: 'I love Web Apps',
  buttons: [{type: 'ok', id: 'ok'}]
});
```

### Without `Bridge`

This package allows calling methods without creating a new `Bridge` instance.
To perform this action, you should use the `postEvent` function which has the
same type as `bridge.postEvent` (actually, the bridge uses the `postEvent`
function internally):

```typescript
import {postEvent} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

postEvent('web_app_setup_back_button', {is_visible: true});
```

Nevertheless, sometimes you need to handle events sent from the native app
emitted as a response to the called method. For example, you would like to
call the `web_app_request_theme` method. As a result, the native app will
emit a `theme_changed` event. Using the default bridge init flow, this event
will be captured by the bridge instance. We can't say the same about the bare
`postEvent` function, so, do not forget about the response event (if it exists)
handling process.

## Listening to events

Events tracking is rather simple thing too. For this purpose, we could
use such methods as `on` and `subscribe`. To remove event listeners, we
use `off` and `unsubscribe`:

```typescript
import {BridgeEventListener, BridgeEventName, Bridge} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

const bridge = Bridge.init();
const listener: BridgeEventListener<'viewport_changed'> = payload => {
  console.log('Viewport changed:', payload)
};
const subListener = (event: BridgeEventName, ...args: any[]) => {
  console.log('Event was called:', event, ...args);
};

// Add event listener.
bridge.on('viewport_changed', listener);

// Add listener for all events.
bridge.subscribe(subListener);

// Remove event listeners.
bridge.off('viewport_changed', listener);
bridge.unsubscribe(subListener);
```

## Checking method support

Bridge itself does not check if the Web Apps method is supported by the current
version of the platform. To check, if the method is supported, you could use
the `supports` function:

```typescript
import {supports} from '@twa-dev/bridge';

supports('web_app_trigger_haptic_feedback', '6.0'); // false
supports('web_app_trigger_haptic_feedback', '6.1'); // true
```

:::tip

It is recommended to use this function before calling Web Apps methods to
prevent applications from stalling and other unexpected behavior.

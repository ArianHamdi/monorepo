# @twa.js/sdk

<LibraryBadges pkg={'@twa.js/sdk'}/>

Made from scratch TypeScript library for seamless communication with Telegram Web Apps functionality.

The code of this library is designed to simplify the process of developers interacting with
Telegram Web Apps. It consists of several individual components, each responsible for a specific
aspect of the Telegram Web Apps ecosystem.

Before you begin using the SDK, we highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the Web Apps
[documentation](../../introduction/about-platform.md) to grasp the fundamental concepts of the
platform.

## Installation

<NpmInstall pkg={'@twa.js/sdk'}/>

## Initialization

Proofread version:
According to the design of this package, the developer has complete control over its lifecycle,
including the initialization process. This means that there are no pre-initialized global
components available for use by the developer; they must create the components themselves.

To simplify the developer's workflow, the package includes a special function called `init`.
This function returns instances of the initialized components, making it easier for developers
to work with the package.

```typescript
import {init} from '@twa.js/sdk';

init().then(components => {
  // Now we have all initialized components.
  const {mainButton, viewport} = components;

  // Add main button event click which will lead to
  // application expansion.
  mainButton.on('click', () => viewport.expand());

  // Update main button information and show it.
  mainButton
    .setColor('#ff0000')
    .setTextColor('#ffffff')
    .setText('Expand')
    .enable()
    .show();
});
```

### Options

The `init` function has the ability to accept options, which are specified as an object in the
first argument of the function. Each option and the options object itself are optional.

```typescript
import {init} from '@twa.js/sdk';

init(options);
```

#### `debug: boolean`

Enables the debug mode, which results in printing more debugging information sent by the SDK.
This option is also passed to the `Bridge` instance during its initialization.

#### `checkCompat: boolean`

Enables the mode in which calls to methods that are not supported by the current version of the
Web App will result in throwing an error. This mode is recommended to be used and is enabled by
default.

#### `targetOrigin: string`

This option is directly passed to the `Bridge` during its initialization. It restricts the list
of parent iframes that are allowed to receive data from the current application. To learn more
about this option, refer to the [documentation](../twa-js-bridge#target-origin).

## Launch parameters

The launch parameters are the initial parameters passed to the Web App. You can find more
information about launch parameters in the [documentation](../../launch-params/structure).

Developers can retrieve the launch parameters by using the `retrieveLaunchParams` function.
This function parses the parameters that begin with the `tgWebApp` prefix.

```typescript
import {retrieveLaunchParams} from '@twa.js/sdk';

console.log(retrieveLaunchParams());

// Output:
// {
//   version: '6.4',
//   initData: {
//     authDate: Mon Feb 20 2023 04:11:25 GMT+0000,
//     hash: 'kSJkn101-)S(djn1',
//   },
//   platform: 'android',
//   themeParams: {
//     backgroundColor: '#ffaabb',
//     buttonColor: '#223112',
//     buttonTextColor: '#111aa3',
//     hintColor: '#000000',
//     linkColor: '#ffffff',
//     secondaryBackgroundColor: '#aaaaaa',
//     textColor: '#bbbbbb',
//   },
// };
```

This function needs no SDK initialization or something like that. It attempts
to extract the launch parameters from the `window.location`. In case, they are
invalid or missing, the function will try to extract these parameters from the
`sessionStorage`. This function is safe to be used when a user reloads Web App
via the `Reload Page` application button.

## Components

All components in this package are supposed to be used as singletons. It means,
you should not create several instances of the same component and use them even
if it is not forbidden. Nevertheless, in this case, there is no warranty,
everything will work fine.

The reason is, each component class stores its state locally and class instances
are not synchronized between each other. So, for instance, in case, developer
creates 2 instances of the `Popup` component and one of them calls `open()`
method, it will change its `isOpened` property to `true`, but the second
instance of `Popup` will not know about it and will still return
`false` value, which is incorrect.

To avoid possible problems, developer can rely on package's `init` function
which provides initialized components which are enough to use across the
application.

### Events

Component instances use the common way of events listening through the `on` and
`off` functions. Here is the example with the `BackButton` component:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from '@twa.js/sdk';

const backButton = new BackButton(...);
backButton.on('click', () => {
  console.log('Back button clicked.');
});
```

You can find the list of supported events in components own documentations.

### Methods support

Almost each component is capable of checking whether its method is supported by
the current Web Apps version or not. To check if some methods are supported,
developer should use the component instance `supports()` function. For example:

```typescript
import {BackButton} from '@twa.js/sdk';
import {Bridge} from '@twa.js/bridge';

let backButton = new BackButton(Bridge.init(), '6.0');
console.log(backButton.supports('show')); // false

backButton = new BackButton(Bridge.init(), '6.3');
console.log(backButton.supports('hide')); // true
```

It is recommended to use this functionality before calling some component method
as long as this will make developer sure, it will work. The list of supported
methods by components is described in each component documentation.

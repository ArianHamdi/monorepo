# `Popup`

The component which controls the currently displayed application popup. It allows developers to open new custom popups and detect popup-connected events. There is more information about this component in this [documentation](../../../ui/popup.mdx).

## Initialization

```typescript
import { Popup } from '@twa.js/sdk';

const popup = new Popup('6.3');
```

## Opening new popup

The `open` function returns a promise which will be resolved in case, the opened popup was closed. `Popup` will resolve a button identifier in case, a user clicked it. Otherwise, `null` will be resolved.

```typescript
popup.open({
  title: 'Hello!',
  message: 'Here is a test message.',
  buttons: [{id: 'my-id', type: 'default', text: 'Default text'}]
});
console.log(popup.isOpened); // true
```

## Events

<ComponentSupportedEvents events={{ isOpenedChanged: '(isOpened: boolean) => void' }} />

## Methods support

<ComponentMethodsSupport methods={['open']} />

# `WebApp`

The component which provides the common Web Apps functionality not covered by other system components.

## Initialization

```typescript
import { WebApp } from '@twa.js/sdk';

// Specify Web Apps version, platform name, header color key
// and background color.
const webApp = new WebApp('6.4', 'webz', 'bg_color', '#ffffff');
```

## Platform

You could get current Web App platform (`tdesktop`, `webz` etc.) by getting `platform` property.

## Opening links

Here comes the list of methods, which allow opening links with help of Web App:

- `openLink(url: string)` - opens link in external browser. Web App will not be closed.
- `openTelegramLink(url: string)` - opens a Telegram link inside Telegram app. The Web App will be closed. It expects passing link in full format, with hostname "t.me".
- `openInvoice(url: string)` - opens an invoice using its url. It expects passing link in full format, with hostname "t.me".

## Header and background

You are able to get and update header and background colors. To get current values of these blocks, you should refer to `headerColor` and `backgroundColor` properties. To update them, use `setHeaderColor(colorKey: HeaderColorKey)` and `setBackgroundColor(color: RGB)` methods.

## Other methods

- `close()` - closes Web App.
- `isVersionAtLeast(version: string)` - checks if current `WebApp` instance version is higher than passed one.
- `ready()` - should be called whenever Web App is ready to be displayed.
- `readTextFromClipboard(): Promise<string | null>` - reads text
  from clipboard and returns extracted data.
- `sendData(data: string)` - sends data to Telegram bot.

# Haptic feedback

Native mobile applications are always filled with interactive components, which
allow user to communicate with its functionality. Such components are mostly
popups, buttons and many others.

Interacting with application (clicking buttons, closing popups etc.), it is
allowed to emit haptic notifications. Commonly, this process is called
`haptic feedback`. In simple words, these events are just mobile device
vibrations. Usage of haptic feedback can make user's experience much better.

There are currently 3 types of notifications which are used in separate cases.
See links at the end of the section for more information.

:::tip

Use this method carefully. Emitting haptic events too often can make an effect
on user's mobile device battery.
